## Goals of the site
This site has been created to learn how to use AJAX API in a customized wordpress theme, calling a "new quote" from our bbdd and alowing a user to upload a new quote by our form, if this user is logged, without conecting directly with our dashboard, and keeping the new post in a "pending" status. 

Wordpress Technology, WP REST API, PHP, MAMP, JQUERY, HTML5 and CSS3. 

> Hand-Crafter Styles
Quote on Dev Wordpress Site has five different sections: home, about, archive and submit a quote. Every archive has a different style and archive files. There you can search by author, categories or tags.

### Installation instructions

## Quotes on Dev Starter

A WordPress starter theme for the Quotes on Dev project, forked from Underscores.

### 1. Download me (don't clone me!)

Then add me to your `wp-content/themes` directory.

### 2. Rename the `quotesondev-starter-master` directory

Make sure that the theme directory name is project appropriate! Do you need `starter` or `master` in the directory name?

### 3. Install the dev dependencies

Next you'll need to run `npm install` **inside your theme directory** to install the npm packages you'll need for Gulp, etc.

### 4. Update the proxy in `gulpfile.js`

Lastly, be sure to update your `gulpfile.js` with the appropriate URL for the Browsersync proxy (so change `localhost[:port-here]/[your-dir-name-here]` to the appropriate localhost URL).

And now would be a good time to `git init` :)
